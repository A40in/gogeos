* Add BufferWithOpts -- provides user more control over buffering options,
including # of quadrant segments, end cap & join styles, mitre limit, and
single-sidedness.

* Add OffsetCurve -- computes a new LineString offset from the input LineString
by a given distance.

* Add WKB encoding/decoding -- geometries can now be constructed from Well-Known
Binary (both raw bytes and hex-encoded), and conversely be output as WKB.

* Initial release
